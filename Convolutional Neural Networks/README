Hello

In this session, I build and trained a Convolutional Neural Network to predict the classification between cats / dogs.

Training set: 8000 images of cats and dogs (4000 dogs/4000 cats)
Test set: 2000 images of cats and dogs

Steps:
- Data preprocessing
- Building CNN
  - Initializing
  - Convolution
  - Pooling
  - Second Convolution Layer
  - Flattening
  - Full connection 
  - Output Layer
- Training CNN
  - Compiling and Fit
- Prediction using my dogs images
  - transforming image to array ( PIL -> array )
  - expanding dimensions, once we divided training set in batchs
  - prediction
